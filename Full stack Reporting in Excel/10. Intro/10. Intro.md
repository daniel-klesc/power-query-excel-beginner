# Goal of course
- teach how to approach reporting in excel
- as tools the course uses Power Query (preparation of data), Power Pivot (data modelling), Visuals in Excel

## Scope
- In Power Query all activities is going to be done UI (no M code)
- Power Pivot how to connect tables and use simple DAX measures/queries

## Out of scope
- Despite data 


## Scope detail

The course will go through all the whole process from modifying source data to make data model and to make visualization/dashboard
To demonstrate functionalities of the technologies mentioned above will be used fictive company Krkos selling outdoor equipment, clothes etc.

# Theory of the full road from source data to dashboard
The process consists of data preparation called ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), data modeling (connecting the tables) and final step visualization

# Full stack process
** Delete
Exists two ways how to proceed.
- From Top to Down
- From Down to Top

## From Down to Top
This process starts from data preparation, followed by data modelling and ends with visualization

### Extract & Transform & Load (ETL)
Definition/Explanation
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load – it’s a process used in data integration and reporting pipelines. Here’s what each part means:

**Extract**:
This step involves pulling data from one or more sources – such as databases, Excel files, APIs, or CSV exports. The goal is to collect raw data for further processing.

**Transform**:
This is where the data gets cleaned, shaped, and organized. It might include:
- Filtering unnecessary rows/columns
- Splitting or merging fields
- Converting formats (e.g., text to dates)
- Calculating new fields
- Joining data from different sources

Power Query in Excel is a tool specifically built for this step.

**Load**:
Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a destination – usually a database, data warehouse, or **Excel data model (like Power Pivot)**, ready for analysis or reporting.

** notes - add explanation database, data warehouse

### Demonstration
Make it in Power Point, show case on changed dataset, make less columns in table



### Data Modeling

##### Instructions for LLM:
Power Pivot in Excel

Generate for me an excel file containing two dimension tables and one fact table from the Krkos company.
The tables are going to be used directly in the data model. It means all the transformations are done.

Generate all necesarry Power Query code as copy & paste.

If you are able to create Power Pivot data model do it.

##### Description of Showcase
- show data model
- show possible power pivot and its possibility to show data
- mention how easy is to slice and dice fact table by dimension tables


# ETL with Power Query
Let's have a look how to start using a PQ.
