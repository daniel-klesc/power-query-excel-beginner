# 🔍 Understanding Data Types in Power Query

## 💡 Why Data Types Matter
Each column in Power Query has a **data type** that defines how the data behaves:
- Can you add it? (Numbers)
- Can you sort it chronologically? (Dates)
- Can you join it to another column? (Matching types needed)
- Can you display it in a report properly?

Incorrect data types can lead to:
- Errors when loading to Excel or Power Pivot
- Wrong aggregations (e.g. summing text!)
- Failed merges or filters
- Misleading reports

## 📘 Common Data Types in Power Query

| Data Type        | Description                                           | Use Case in Sales Table            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Text`           | A sequence of characters.                            | For IDs, codes, names, categories  |
| `Whole Number`   | An integer number (no decimals).                     | Units Sold                         |
| `Decimal Number` | A number with decimals.                              | Total Amount, Price                |
| `Date`           | Stores only the date portion (no time).              | Order Date                         |
| `Date/Time`      | Stores both date and time.                           | Use only if time is also needed    |
| `Logical`        | True/False (Boolean).                                | Used in flags or conditions        |
| `Currency`       | Like decimal but formatted as money (not in PQ UI).  | Better handled in Excel after load |

### 🆔 `Order ID` and `Product Code`
- **Type:** `Text`
- These are unique identifiers, not meant for calculations.

### 📅 `Order Date`
- **Type:** `Date`
- Enables sorting by date, filtering for periods, and grouping over time.

### 🔢 `Units Sold`
- **Type:** `Whole Number`
- Represents count of items, no decimals.

### 🏪 `Channel`

## ⚠️ Pro Tips

- **Always check types after importing!** PQ may guess incorrectly.
- **Apply types after filtering**, to avoid processing rows you don’t need.
- **Consistent types** are crucial when merging tables.
- If numbers appear aligned to the left in PQ, they’re likely still **Text**!

📎 **In Power Query UI:**
- Use **Transform > Data Type dropdown** in the toolbar
- Or right-click the column header → **Change Type**

Correcting data types early avoids many downstream issues in Excel or Power BI.
