# 🔄 Connecting to CSV in Excel: Two Approaches

## 📁 File: `Krkos_CustomerBehavior.csv`

This file contains basic customer interaction data:
- `CustomerID`
- `VisitDate`
- `Channel`
- `PagesViewed`
- `Purchased`

## ✅ Version 1: Just Load the Data (No Transformation)

### 🔹 Steps:
1. Open a blank Excel workbook.
2. Go to the **Data** tab.
3. Click **Get Data** → **From File** → **From Text/CSV**.
4. Select the file `Krkos_CustomerBehavior.csv`.
5. Excel will show a preview and auto-detect delimiter (comma).
6. Click the **Load** button (⚠️ _not_ Transform Data).

### 💡 Result:
- A new table is created directly in your worksheet.
- No editing or transformation steps are recorded.
- Ideal for fast imports with clean data.

## 🛠️ Version 2: Load via Power Query Editor (Transform First)

### 🔹 Steps:
1. Open Excel and go to the **Data** tab.
2. Click **Get Data** → **From File** → **From Text/CSV**.
3. Select the file `Krkos_CustomerBehavior.csv`.
4. In the preview window, click **Transform Data**.

### 🧰 In Power Query Editor:
- Review each column’s type:
  - `CustomerID` → Whole Number
  - `VisitDate` → Date
  - `Channel` → Text
  - `PagesViewed` → Whole Number
  - `Purchased` → True/False
- Rename columns if needed.
- You can also:
  - Remove rows (e.g., errors or blanks)
  - Filter by channel (e.g., only "Online")
  - Split, merge, or format text fields

### ✅ Final Step:
- Click **Close & Load** to push the transformed data to Excel.

### 💡 Result:
- Data is cleaned and standardized.

## 2. Connect to an Excel File (Sales & Inventory)

We will now connect to the `Krkos_SalesInventory.xlsx` file which has two sheets: `Sales` and `Inventory`.

### 📍 Steps:
1. In the same or new workbook, go to the **Data** tab.
2. Click **Get Data** → **From File** → **From Workbook**.
3. Browse to and select the file: `Krkos_SalesInventory.xlsx`.
4. Click **Import**.

### 📄 Navigator Pane:
- You’ll see a list of sheets: check both `Sales` and `Inventory`.
- Select one at a time and click **Transform Data**.

### 🧰 Power Query Editor (repeat for each sheet):
#### For `Sales` sheet:
- Confirm data types:
  - `ProductID` → Text
  - `StoreID` → Text
  - `Date` → Date
  - `UnitsSold` → Whole Number
  - `Revenue` → Decimal Number

#### For `Inventory` sheet:
- Confirm data types:
  - `ProductID` → Text
  - `WarehouseStock` → Whole Number
  - `StoreStock` → Whole Number

- Optionally rename the queries to `Sales` and `Inventory`.

- Click **Close & Load** to bring the tables into Excel.

## 🧠 Tip:
You can later use **Merge Queries** in Power Query to join these datasets together by `ProductID` and build richer reports.
